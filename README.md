Power loss presents a problem for systems, even when uninterruptible power
supplies are in place. Frequently, these battery backups fail without warning,
and a user can face data loss if his or her remote server dies. However, due to
capacitance in normal power supplies, the server can still operate for a short
time after power is cut. In this paper we analyze the compute time provided by
various capacitance values. We also present the Meerkat protocol, which takes
advantage of the time between loss of power and loss of computation ability on
a dying machine to notify the “buddy” Meerkat.
